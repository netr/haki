      <Front>What are the four most common reasons an inequality sign must be reversed?</Front>
      <Back><div>The four most common reasons an inequality sign must be reversed are:<br>1. Multiplying or dividing both sides by a negative number: When you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign must be reversed.<br>2. Taking the reciprocal of both sides: If both sides of the inequality are positive and you take the reciprocal of each side, the inequality sign must be reversed.<br>3. Switching sides: If you swap the expressions on either side of the inequality, the inequality sign must be reversed to maintain the correct relationship.<br>4. Applying a decreasing function: When applying a function that is strictly decreasing (e.g., taking the logarithm of both sides in some cases), the inequality sign must be reversed.</Back>
